        <p>Education is not just about going to school and getting a degree. Its about widening your knowledge and absorbing the truth about life.-Shakuntla Devi. Treading on this philosophy Buddha Group of Institutions (BGI) has been nurturing and rearing talents to the service of society and nation for more than a decade. Holistic development of students is at the core of our mission for the past decade and it has been testimony to our academic excellence as reflected by the various awards and accolades won by our students in various co-curricular, extra -curricular and sports activities at various regional and national level events at premier institutions.
            People Educational Society started its mission in 2009 with Buddha Institute of Technology and this decade long experience in imparting technical education successfully has given us much confidence to start new courses and we have now 6 Institutes under our umbrella i.e. Budhha Group of Institutions offering undergraduate / Postgraduate & diploma courses in Engineering, pharmacy, management, science, commerce & para-medical courses. Further, new courses are on anvil.
            I extend my best wishes to all the authorities teachers, staff and students of BGI

        <p>There are no limits to what one can accomplish, except the limits one places on one's own thinking. Having clear vision backed by definite plans gives us confidence to strive hard for attaining the goals. Since 2009 we have come a long way to be a group of institutions, i.e. Buddha Group of Institutions, offering regular and professional courses in engineering, science, commerce, pharmacy & para-medical.
            We strongly believe that the future belong to the competent. Get good, get better and be the best. We foster these attributes in our students through various co- curricular, extra-curricular and sports activities to enable them to reach new heights in their professional life. Our emphasis is on pragmatic and inclusive teaching pedagogy, instilling confidence among students to pursue their innovative ideas to fruition. We encourage our faculty members to keep themselves abreast with the current development through various Faculty Development Programmes, workshops, conferences etc. and enable them expand their knowledge in their respective fields and domain specific research. Continual growth and progress give vibrant colors to achievements and success. The confidence shown by students and parents in Buddha Group of Institutions motivates us to give our best and chart new course by mutual learning and support.
